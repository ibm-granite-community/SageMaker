The events mentioned are: \"the brave knight\" confronting and defeating the dragon. By adding \"and then,\" the sentence smoothly transitions from the knight's heroic action to the following outcomeâ€”the defeat of the dragon. Without \"and then,\" the sentence would read awkwardly as a series of separated actions rather than a cohesive narrative."
